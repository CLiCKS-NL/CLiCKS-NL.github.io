## The Logistics Data Sharing Infrastructure
"Digitization of supply and logistics chains offers both opportunities and threats to the logistics sector. Opportunities can be found in a rapidly growing data economy driving new business models and digital ecosystems and platforms. This is accompanied by innovative start-ups developing advanced value propositions, such as Flexport or Uber Freight. At the same time, the digital transformation also poses threats. International trade disputes demonstrate the need for Europe to ensure knowledge-based value creation, in which Europe must be prevented from becoming too dependent on data platforms and technology originating in other parts of the world. In addition, more independence can help to mitigate the vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, data security and loss of control over potentially sensitive data."

## The CLiCKS project in a nutshell
"The Dutch NWO Research project 'Connecting Logistics interfaces, Converters, Knowledge and Standards' (CLiCKS) - former ‘IDS Connector Store and Interoperability Simulator for SMEs’ - aims at lowering the barriers related to data sharing, especially for SMEs, by researching and designing an integrated solution that focuses on two main problems:
P1. Data interoperability: to share data needed for collaboration between logistics companies
P2. Data sovereignty: to protect proprietary data that has strategic value for logistics companies

The integrated solution is a ‘logistics data space’, in which the CLiCKS project will develop a ‘connector store’ that enables semantic interoperability in data sharing between heterogeneous ICT environments and an ‘interoperability simulator’ that enables assessment of collaboration opportunities and interoperability issues prior implementation."

## The CLiCKS Approach
(From Sebastian paper in SIFAI 2020)
Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in logistics experience practical barriers when trying to use, exchange, share, and exploit real-time data in their operational processes. Such barriers include the abundance of proprietary data formats and schemes, the cost of implementing standards, the lack of trust among partners, the lack of IT expertise, and the uncertainty about benefits and return on investments. 

CLiCKS is a research project that aims at lowering these barriers. The core proposition revolves around the application of a federated approach based on the concepts of the International Data Space (IDS). CLiCKS  architecture presents two main components: 
1. A connector store, offering connectors to realize data exchange between heterogeneous ICT environments
2. An interoperability simulator, to explore collaboration opportunities prior to implementation
